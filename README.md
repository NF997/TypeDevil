# Seminar Report and Presentation on TypeDevil
This report is part of the seminar <a href="https://www.sec.in.tum.de/i20/teaching/ss2018/common-security-flaws">Common Security Flaws in JavaScript based Applications"</a>, which was held by Paul Muntean from the Chair of IT Security at the Faculty of Informatics of the Technical University of Munich. The seminar took place in the summer semester 2018 and dealt with several scientific papers related to JavaScript Security.
The paper I took a deeper look at is "TypeDevil: Dynamic Type Inconsistency Analysis for JavaScript", published in 2015 by Michael Pradel, Parker Schuh and Koushik Sen. My report illustrates the general problem the paper tries to address, introduces TypeDevil as a possible solution and compares it to an alternative approach, namely additional static type systems.
